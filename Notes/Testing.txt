Testing a react application is of three type:
    Unit Testing: Testing Each component separately.
    Integration Testing
    End to End Testing

Setting up testing in our app:
    Install React Testing Library
    Install jest
    install babel dependencies if using parcel bundler
    configure Babel
    Configure parcel config file to disable default babel transpilation
    Jest confighuration
    install jsDOM lbrary
    install @babel/preset-react -to make JSX work in test cases
    include @babel/preset-react inside babel config
    install @testing-library/jest-dom

Testing runs in jsDOM kind of broweser to run test cases.

//Creating fetch function async call mock because fetch runs inside
//Browser and in jest-dom its not provided so we have to define the mock fetch function 
//which is async and return mock data
