* If our application has too manu components like 1000+ components what happens is when we build it
    for production the bundler like parcel compresses it and create a single JS file for browser
    but it will decrease the efficiency of our application if lots of components are bundled in to a single
    component.
    So to avoid it we create multiple bundles for each Features like in swiggy instamart would have
    separate bundle and food delivery separate.
    This is achieved using Chunking, LazyLoading, Dynmaic Bundling, Code Splitting, on demand loading.
    The js file will be loaded in browser in parts.

* React provides lazy hook to achieve this which takes a call back function to import the component and
    we can use suspence hook to show a fallback UI while lazy script loads in network tab.
    React, Suspense is a feature that allows components to "wait" for something, typically 
    asynchronous data, before rendering. It helps in handling asynchronous operations like 
    data fetching in a declarative way.
