## Interview
## Intro:
Top Down Approach

**Hi, I’m Tarique Anwar, currently working as a Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys.** where I am associated with 
**Danske Bank Gen AI team** as a **Full-Stack Developer**, collaborating with a team of five developers.  

currently I am working on two ongoing projects 
1. **Self-Service Assistant Management Portal** – A platform where users can create their own custom AI assistants by filling out an onboarding form and 
uploading files to build a knowledge base. These assistants can be tailored for specific use cases like **HR assistants or IT-support assistants**.  
2. **Assistant Playground** – A chat interface where users can interact with their created assistants.  

Additionally, my pilot project at Danske Bank was **DanskeGPT UI**, a **Generative AI chatbot** that enables users to interact with 
    **DanskeGPT AI models**. I also worked on a feature that allows users to **upload files and chat based on their content**, 
    whether for **extracting insights or generating summaries**.

### Tech Stack:
Coming to tech-stack All these applications follow a **micro-frontend architecture**.  
- **For Frontend we are using** React with TypeScript, Redux for state management, and React Router for dynamic routing, enabling a 
    **config-driven architecture with reusable components with the help of dunamic props**.  
- **for BFF we are using:** Node.js with Express, JsonWebToken JWT for authentication, and password encryption using bcrypt, 
    which serves as an **auth middleware for API calls**.  

### Previous Experience:  
Before working with Danske Bank, I was part of **IBAP (Infosys Banking API Platform)**— where I worked on the developer portal 
for open banking API catalogs**. Users could publish and test APIs, and the platform used:  
- **Frontend:** React and Angular (Micro-frontend architecture).  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot microservices with **MySQL and MongoDB** as databases.

## At the end ask tech question like: 
what technologies you are using in the project/ tech stack how you are managing state, which testing library, deployment cycle etc, 
what projects team is working on
what is the focus of team
