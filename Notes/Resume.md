## Interview

## Intro:

## Top Down Approach

Hi, **I’m Tarique Anwar**, currently working as a Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys with 3 years of experience as a 
**Full-Stack Developer**, where I am associated with the Danske Bank Gen AI team, collaborating with a team of five developers.

currently I am working on two ongoing projects

1. **Self-Service Assistant Management Portal** – A platform where users can create and manage their own custom AI assistants by filling out an 
    onboarding form and uploading files to build a knowledge base. These assistants can be tailored for specific use cases like 
    **HR assistants or IT-support assistants**.
2. **Assistant Playground** – A chat interface where users can interact with their created assistants.

Additionally, my pilot project at Danske Bank was **DanskeGPT**, a **Generative AI chatbot** that enables users to interact with
**DanskeGPT AI models**.
## OPTIONAL:  I also worked on a feature that allows users to **upload files and chat based on their content**,
whether for **extracting insights or generating summaries**.

### Tech Stack: For all our applications we are using
- **For Frontend we are using** React with TypeScript, // Redux for state management, and React Router for dynamic routing, enabling a
  **config-driven architecture with reusable components with the help of dynamic props**.
- **for BAckend we are using:** Node.js with Express, JsonWebToken JWT for authentication, //and password encryption using bcrypt,
  which serves as an **auth middleware for API calls**. and we used Mongoose to perform DB operations.

### Previous Experience:

Before working with Danske Bank, I was part of **IBAP (Infosys Banking API Platform)**— where I worked on the developer portal
for open banking API catalogs\*\*. where Users could publish and test APIs, and the platform used:

- **Frontend:** React and Angular (Micro-frontend architecture).
- **Backend:** Spring Boot microservices with **MySQL and MongoDB** as databases.

## At the end ask tech question like:

what technologies you are using in the project/ tech stack how you are managing state, which testing library, deployment cycle etc,
what projects team is working on
what is the focus of team
